#len(s) Return the length (the number of items) of an object. The argument may be a sequence (such as a string, bytes, tuple, list, or range) or a collection (such as a dictionary, set, or frozen set).

#For this problem we assume each represent the coordinate of each queen on a vector.
#The number on the element represents the row while the position on the vector represents the column.
#The coordinates for the picture above is given as:

#[3, 0, 4, 7, 5, 2, 6, 1]#

#We are eliminating Rook moves finding permutations of rows. This will ensure that the rows and columns do not overlap.
#Bishop moves are eliminated by using set() and number of queens, N. 
#We will check Bishop for both diagonals. If there is no overlap, the set of 8 diagonals will be unique and will have lenght 8.
